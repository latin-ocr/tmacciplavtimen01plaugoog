and interesting to the Roman audience. The incon·
sistencies that are of necessity present in plays thus
made up do not seem to have been distasteful to the
Romans.

The plot of the “ Menaechmi '’ turns upon mistaken
identity in the case of twin brothers. One of them,
while still a child, had been stolen from his father and
taken to Epidamnus3 the other twin, when he arrived
at manhood‚ came from Syracuse to Epidamnus in
search of his brother. The two are constantly mis-
taken‚ the one for the other, by the friends of each,
until in the last. act the two happen on the stage to-
gether, and the mystery is solved. The plot is of
special interest to the English reader, as having sug-
gested that of Shakspeare's “Comedy of Errors.” The
“argument ’⁹ preceding the text of the ‘⁶ Menaechmi ”
was probably not written by Plautus. It appears to
have been added at a much later time, Ritschl thinks
in the second century A.D.

There have been many translations and adaptations
of the “Menaechmi ” in modern times. R. Steinhoff
gives no less than ten imitations in the Italian. The
first of these, said to have been acted in 1486, was a
translation entitled ‘-‘ Menechino di Plaut0.” Of the
others mentioned, some are translations more or less
literal‚ while some resemble the original mainly in the
vfact that they have plots bringing out striking resem-
blances between characters. In the Spanish there is a
-“ Comedia de los Menecmos‚” by J uan di Timoneda· ’
