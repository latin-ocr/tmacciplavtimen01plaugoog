³ come to myassistance, citizens of Epidamnus, · (To the slave-3.)
¹ Why don't you let me go?

Mes. (Cominy out of ERo‘rnnu's house.) Ο ye immortal
gods! Ι pray you, what do my eyes behold? Some unknown
fellows are most wickedly carrying off my master on their
shoulders.

Mon. Does any one dare bring me aid?

Mos. (Starts for help.) Ι, master, dare most boldly. Oh l
disgraceful and wicked deed, citizens of EpidamnuS, that my
master, here in a peaceful city, in broad daylight, should be
carried off on·the street, who came to you a free man. (S houts
to the slave-3.) · ᾗ Let him go 1

Men. I implore you, whoever you are, give me aid. Do
not permit such an outrage to be wickedly inflicted on me.

Mos. (Starts to the rescae.) Yes‚ Ι will give you aid, and
defend you, and vigorously assist you. N ever will I allow
you to perish 3 ’tis better that I perish. Tear out the eye of
that fellow, I beg of you, master, who holds you by the shoul*
der. I’ll make a sowing on the faces of these fellows and
plant my fists. By Hercules, γοα are carrying this man off
to your own very great misfortune. Let him go 1 (Strikes ’
them.)

Mon. (Struyyliny.) 1 have this fellow’s eye.

Mes. Make his eye—socket show'in his head. You villains 1

’ you robbers 1 you pirates 1 (Strikes ayain and ayain.)

slaves. We are undone 1 Mercy 1

Mos.11et him go, then.

Mon. (To slav-98.) Why do γοα touch me? (To MES-
SENIO. ) Pummel them with y our fists.

Mes. Get outl . away with you 1 Go to perdition 1 (Three
run away.) Here’s for γοα too. (He attacks the last one.)

,Ι Because you are the last to yield‚ you shall have this reward.
