smum 1.] MENAECHMI 29

ACT ΙΙ.
Semta I.

Enter MENAECHMUS II. (SosmLEs) os Syracuse and ΜΕ5-
5ΕΝΙΟ, his slave, from the har-bor, with two sailor3 carry-

iny bayyaye.

Men. Sos. In my opinion, Messenio, sailors have no greater
pleasure than that felt on catching sight of land, when they
are afar off on the deep.

Mes, There is a greater (I shall speak plainly) if on ap-
proaching, you see the land that has been your home. But, I
beg of you, why have we now come to Epidamnus? Are we
going around all islands as the sea does?

Men. Soa. I have come to seek my own twin brother.

Mea. What, pray, will be the end of the search for him?
This is⁴ the sixth year since we commenced it. sWe have
sailed around Istria, Spain, Marseilles, Illyria, all the Adriatic
and Magna Graecia, and all Italian countries that the sea
touches. If you were hunting a needle, you would have found
it long ago, I believe, if it were in existence. You are seek-
ing a dead man among the living ; for, if your brother were
alive, we should have found him long since.

Men. Sos. Well then, I am looking for some one who can
assure me of that fact, who can say that he knows that my
brother is dead. After that I’ll trouble myself no more with
the quest ; but otherwise, I shall not give up the search 5ο
long as Ι live. I know how dear he is to my heart.
