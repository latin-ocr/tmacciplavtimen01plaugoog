Phr. Ι am going. (Exit.)

Old Man. Farewell. (Exit.)

Mon. (Soliloquizes.) My father-in-law is gone, the doctor
is gone, Ι am alone. Oh, Jupiter Ι why is it that these men

ᾗ a single day since I was born, nor am I msane, nor do I be-
g gin fights and quai-tels· Healthy myself, I see others in
÷ health, I recognize men, speak to them. Are not they who
⁷ maliciously say that I am insane, insane themselves? What
shall I now do? Ι want to go home, but my wife doesn't
allow it ; moreover, no one lets me in here. I’ve had abomi-

nable luck. I'll stay here right along ; toward night indeed,
I think, I shall be let into the house. (Stands near his door.)
