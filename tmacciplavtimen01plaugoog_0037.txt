ing after, what Ῑ shall bring back, what Ι have done away
from hom& Ι have married an inspector of customS‚ — so
necessary is it for me to tell everything that I have done or
am doing.

Ι have made too much of a pet of you. Now, indeed, Ι
shall tell you what I am going to do. Since I provide you
well with maid-servants, food‚ clothing, money, drapery,
purple, and since you are in want of nothing, you will look
out for trouble, if γοα are wise 3 you will quit watching
your husband. And, too, that you may not watch me to

no purpose, on account of your officiousness I shall to-day
ἵ find a woman and arrange for a dinner somewhere away
from home.

Pon. (Aside.) This man pretends that he is scolding his
wife ; he is talking at me, for if he dines away from home,
he certainly is punishing me, not his wife.

Mon. (Startinq away from the door.) Hurral by graciouS,
Ι have at last driven my wife away from the door by my
tauntS. Where are these intriguing husbands? Why don't
they all bring gifts and congratulations to me, because I have
fought so bravely? Thus ought one skilfully to deceive this
cunning guardian. It was an excellent trick‚ it was com-
mendable, it was charming, it was well executed (liftinq up
his cloak he exposes the mantle). Ι have stolen this from the
vixen to my own loss ; it shall be taken to my mistress. I
have taken spoil from the enemy to the profit of our allies.

Pon. (Cominq forward.) Hey, young man! What share,
pray, have I in that spoil?
