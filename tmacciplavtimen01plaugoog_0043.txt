Senum 111.] MENAECHMI 23

Mon. (EROTIUM appears at the door of her house.) Hold,
hold, Ι beg you, by the gods! Look‚ she herself is coming
out! Ah, see the sunl Isn't it completely darkened by
comparison with the brilliancy of her beauty?

——000—

Scmm III. ‚
Enter EROTIUM from her house.

Ero. My own dear MenaechmuS, welcomel

Pon. What of me?

Ero. (Tuminy away.) You don't count.

Pon. But the same provision is made for the supernumer-
aries as for the soldiers.

Men. (To EROTIUM.) I arranged a contest between him
and me at your house to-day.

, Ero. It shall be done to-day.

Men. In that contest we shall both drink. Whichever
shall there be found the better warrior with the bowl is
yourS. Consider and decide with which one you will be
to-night. (Startinq back in admiration.) How I hate my
wife, my darling‚ when I look at youl

Ero. (Takiny hold of the manile.) And yet, you can't help
wearing something of hers (liftiny it up). What is this? ‚

Mon. Spoil for you, my rosebud, of which I despoiled my
wife.

Ero. You easily excel, as you are more excellent than any
one else that courts me.

Pon. (Aside.) The woman is petting him a little, while she
is looking to see what she can steal 3 (to Erotium) for, if you

loved him, his nose would be off by this time with your biting
him. '
