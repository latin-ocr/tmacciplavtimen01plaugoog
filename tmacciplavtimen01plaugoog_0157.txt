PREPARED UNDER THE DIRECTION OF

JAMES C. EGBERT

PROFESSOR OF LATIN IN COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY

FOR THE YOUNGER STUDENTS IN COLLEGE CLASSES

Although great progress has been made during re-
cent years in the scholarly editing of Latin textS‚ the
result has been books too cumbersome and expensive
for the younger studentS. Not finding helpful infor-
mation in the elaborate introduction with its extensive
data as to usageS, quotationS, and referenceS, the stu·
dent naturally turns to translations for aid. The vol·
umes in this new series will endeavor to combat this
tendency by presenting notes which, while scholarly,
shall be brief and concise. . Each book will have a short
introduction and standard text and a commentary for
the interpretation of the text. The series will contain
the most useful works available for class use and will
be issued at prices sufficiently reasonable to make the
adoption of the volumes possible in large general classes·
