THE MENAEGHMI OF Τ. MAGGIUS PLAUTUS

—0—

ARGUMENT

THERE was a Sicilian merchant who had twin sons. After
one had been stolen the father died. The grandfather on the
father’s side gave the name of the stolen child to the one left ⁸
at home, calling him Menaechmus instead of Sosicles.

This son, after he had grown up, seeks his brother all
over the world. Finally he comes to Epidamnus, whither
the stolen youth had been taken. All residents of Epidam-
nus believe that the stranger is their citizen Menaechmus,
and as such, mistress, wife, and father-in-law address him.
There· the brothers at last recognize each other.
