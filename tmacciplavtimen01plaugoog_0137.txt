you had done.

Mes. Certainly.

Men. Sos. Why, most assuredly it is more likely that I
myself should become a slave than that I should free γοα.

Enter MENAECHMUS os Epidamnus from ERo'rmM's} house.

Men. (To ΕΒοΤῙυΜ, in the house.) Even if you should
swear by your eyes, not the more, in sooth‚ by that will you
prove that I stole the mantle and bracelet of you, vile
creatureS.

. Mes. Ye immortal gods 1 what do I see?

Men. Sos. What do you see?

Mes. Your likeneSS.

Men. Sos, What do you mean?

Mes. Your image ; he is as like you as can be.

‚Men Sos, (Loolciny at MENAECHMUS.) In truth, he is not
unlike‚ so far as I know my own looks,

Men. (To MESSENIO. ) Oh, young man, greeting to you
ι who saved me, whoever you are.

Mea. Young man, tell me your name, if you don' t object?
