ACT IV:

SCENE Ι.

Enter Manae-fluns somenae from the Forum, and immedi- ⁴
ately afterward, the Wmm of MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus
enters from her house.

Men. Sos. (soliloquizes.) Ι acted very foolishly awhile
ago, when Ι entrusted the purse with the money to Messenio.
He has, I suppose, slipped into some low house.

wite. I'll look out to see how soon my husband is coming
back home. But, ah 1 Ι see him. Ι am saved ; he is bring-
ing back the mantle.

Mon. Sos. I wonder where Messenio is strolling about
now?

wite. I’ll go and welcome the manwith such language as
he deserves. Aren’t you ashamed to appear in my sight, you
scandal of a fellow, with that costume?

Mon. Sos. What is it ; what disturbs you, woman?

wite. Do you dare to mutter even a single word, impu-
dence 1 or speak to me?

Men. Sos. What, pray, have I done, that I dare not speak
to you?

wite. Do you ask me? Oh 1 the shameless insolence of
the man 1 ·

Men. Sos. Do you know, woman, why the Greeks used to
say that Hecuba was a dog?

wite. Indeed, Ι don't know.

, Men. Sos. Because Hecuba used to do the same thing that'
you are now doing; she used to heap all sorts of insults on
willomsoever she met, and therefore justly she began to be
ca led a dog

wife.1'11 not stand this shameless conduct of yours Ι Ι
would prefer to live here as a widow all my life rather than
endure the insults that you heap upon me.
