INTRODUOTION

Trms MAccms PLAUTUS, the author of the “Me-
naechmi,’' lived from some time before 251 to 184 B.c.
He was born in Umbria, of poor but free parents. We
may suppose that he went to Rome early in life to seek

.his fortune. At any rate, he is said to have been em-
ployed there in some service about a theatre. We are
told by Gellius that he made a small fortune by stage
decorating, but afterwards lost his money in specula-
tion, and was compelled to work in a tread-mill for his
daily broad. While engaged in this menial occupatiori,
he wrote several plays, which brought sufficient fame
and fortune to their author to enable him to devote
himself for the rest of his life to the pursuit of his art.

Twenty of the comedies of Plautus are extant. They
are all characterized by rollicking‚ broad fun. Plautus
was the poet of the common folk, and portrays life in
an unaffected, homely way. In accordance with the
practice of Roman dramatists in his time, he borrowed
the plots of his plays from the Greek. The Greek
original of the “ Menaechmi ” is not known, but the

‚ preponderance of evidence seems to show that it was
a comedy by Posidippus. The “Menaechmi ” belongs
to the class of comedies known as fabulae palliatae, that

· is, it retains the costumes and setting of the Greek

h. play from which it was taken, embodying only enough

Ἐἰ of Roman manners and customs to make it intelligible
