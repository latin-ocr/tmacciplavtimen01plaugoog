Senum IL] MENAECHMI . 35

Men. Sos. You speak as a sane man, when γοα call me by
name ; but where did you get acquainted with me?

cyl. Where did I get acquainted with you, the man that
has my mistress Erotium as a mistress?

Men. Sos. No, indeed, Ι haven't, nor do I know who you
are.

051. I am Cylindrus Don't γοα know my name?

Men. Sos. Whether γοα are Cylindrus or ColindruS, to the .

deuce with you‘. I don’t know γοα, and Ι don't want to know
you.

cyl. Don't you know me, the servant who so often fills
your cup when you are drinking at our house?

Mes. Woe is me, that I have nothing with which to smash
this fellow's headl

Men. Sos. (To CYLINDRUs.) Are γοα accustomed to fill
the cup for me, a man that before to-day has never been in
Epidamnus, nor seen it?

1 cyl. Do you deny it?

Men. Sos. Deny it? 1 should say I did1

Cyl. (Pointiny to the house os MENAnchns os Epidam-
πω.) Don't γοα live in that house yonder?

Mon. Sos. May the gods destroy those who live therel

Cyl. (Aside.) He is the one who is insane, — he who is
calling down destruction upon himself. (To MENAECHMUS.)
Do you hear, Menaechmus?

Mon. Sos. What do γοα want? .

cxl. If you would take my advice, γοα would, if you are
wise, order that a porker be procured for yourself with that
shilling which you just 'now promised to give me ; for you,
in Hercules' name, are surely not altogether sane, Menaech-
mus, who are calling down curses upon yourself.

Men. Sos. O, bah! by Hercules, the man is a wind-bag
and nuisance.

Cyl. (Aside to the audience.) He often jokes with me in
that way. He is as funny as you please, when his wife is not
around. (To MENAECHMUS.) What say you?

Men. Sos. What do γοα want, you good-for-nothing‘?

Cyl. (Shows the contenis of his baslcet.) Is this that γοα
see enough provision for you three, or shall Ι provide more
