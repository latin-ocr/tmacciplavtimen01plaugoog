‘senna III-l MENAECHMI 101

‚reached by ointment of hellebore. But what say you,

Menaechmus?

Mon. What do γοα want? ’

rhy. Tell me what 1 ask : do you drink white wine or
dark?

Men. Why do γοα ask that?

Phr. It is of great importance what the color is·

Mon. Why don’t you go to perdition?

Old, Man. Now in truth he begins to rave.

Men. Why don’t you ask whether I usually eat purple or
scarlet or yellow bread ; whether I eat birds with scales or
fishes with feathers? ⁸

Old Man. Oh my 1 do γοα hear how wildly he talks? Why
do you hesitate to give him some potion before madness comes ·
upon him?

rhy. Just wait, I’ll question him a bit about other mat-
ters.

Old Man. You kill me with your talking.

Phy. (To Mnmncnnus.) Tell me this ε do your eyes ever
get hard? ,

Men. What, do you take me for a locust, you good-for-
nothing?

Phy. In this at least he surely does not answer me like an
insane man. Do you sleep soundly until daylight; do you
easily go to sleep when you lie down?
