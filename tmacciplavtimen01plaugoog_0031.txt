‚Paonootml MENAEC'HMI ’.11 .

That merchant of Epidamnus whom Ῑ just mentioned, who
stole MenaechmuS‚ had no children except his richeS. He

adopted the stolen boy as his own son, gave him a dowered
wife, and willed his property to him.

The twin that was stolen dwells here. The twin that lives
at Syracuse will come to-day to Epidamnus with his slave, to
seek his twin brother. This city is Epidamnus, while this
play is on; when another is brought out, it will become an-
other town. Just so actors also change their parts; at one time
one acts the procurer, again the youth, then the old man, or
poor beggar, or king, or parasite, or soothsayer.
