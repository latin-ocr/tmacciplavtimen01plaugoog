senna 11.] MENAECHMI 73

Mon. Ι swear to you, wife, by Jupiter and all the gods —
isn't that enough for you? — I didn't give it.

Pon. But we swear‚ by Hercules indeed, that we are telling
the truth.

Mon. But Ι didn't give it away for good, but simply lent
it to be used.

wife. Well, in saith, I don’t give away your cape or cloak
to any one to use. It is right for the woman to give away
woman’s clothing ; the man the man's. Why don’t you bring
the mantle home?

Men. I’ll warrant you it shall be brought home.

wife. You will do it, as Ι think, for your own sake ; for
you shall never enter the house unless youbring the mantle
with you. I'm going home.

Pon. What is going to be done for me, who has done you
this favor?

wite. The favor will be returned when anything is stolen
from your house (she 9008 in).

Pon. Well, by heavenS‚ that will never be, for I have noth-
ing at home to lose. May the gods destroy both man and
wife 1 I'll be off to the Forum, for Ι see plainly that Ι have
fallen out with this family (exit).

Men. (Soliloquizes.) My wife thinks she has spited me,
when she shuts me out of doors. Just as if Ι didn’t have
another better place to go (shakiny his fist at the door). If
[displease you, Ι must endure it ; but Ι shall please Erotium
here.
