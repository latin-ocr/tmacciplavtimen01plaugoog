PREFACE

THIS edition of the text and a translation of the
“ Menaechmi ’⁹ of Plautus was put forth as a libretto to
accompany a presentation of the play by students of
the University of Michigan in 1890. That first issue
is now exhausted‚ and advantage has been taken of the
reprinting to make a few changes.

The Latin text remains substantially that given in
Brix’s edition, with slight modifications‚ made in ac-
cordance with evidence presented chiefly by Leo. A
few fragmentary lines and one short passage have been
omitted. In translating occasional phrases were bor-
rowed from the translations by Thornton and Riley.
Some help was received also from the various commen-

’ taries. The Introduction offers a few hints in regard

to the play for the benefit of those who are not familiar
with the original.

For the preparation of the new edition I am indebted
to Dr. Gilbert H. Taylor‚ of the University of Michigan.
