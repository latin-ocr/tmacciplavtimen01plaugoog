Men. (Takes off his own cloak.) Hold this, Peniculus, Ι
want to offer the spoils that I have vowed.

Pon. (Takiny it.) All right 3 but, Ι begyou, dance as you
are with 'the mantle on. “

Men. Ι dance? By Hercules! you are crazy.

Pon. Am I, or rather you? If you don't dance (takinq
hold of the manile), then take it off.

Men. (Pushinq him away.) I have stolen this to-day at a
mighty risk. In my opinion, indeed, Hercules did not in-
cur so great a risk in stealing the girdle of Hippolyta (takes
off the manile and hands it to EROTIUM). Take it as your
own, since you are the only living creature congenial to my
taste.

Ero. With this feeling ought true lovers to be inspired.

Pon. (Aside.) At least such as would rush headlong into
beggary.

Men. I bought that for my wife last year for four minae.1

Pon. (Aside.) The four minae are undoubtedly gone for-
ever, according to the account rendered. ᾗ

Men. (To ERo'rIUM.) Do you know what I would like to
have you attend to?

Ero. Tell me ; I will do what you desire.

Men. Arrange for a dinner at your house for us three.
Get some dainties at the market-place, — a pork chop, or'
smoked ham, or hog's jowl‚ or something ,of that sort, which
boiled tender and placed on the table will give a fellow the
appetite of· a hawk. And quickly ton.

Ero. Certainly, it shall be done

Men. (Startiny away.) We are off for the Forum ; we'll
soon be back. While the meat is cooking we'll go and have
a drink.

Ero. Come back when you please 3 everything will be ready.

Men. Please make haste. -
