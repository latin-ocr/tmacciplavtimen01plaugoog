2 Scmm 11.] MENAECHMI 21

. Men. There is a place, where we may, without the knowl-
edge of my wife, burn this day on its funeral pyre and hold
a wake over the ashes, - ι

Pon. Well, come then! since you ask the fair thing, how
soon shall Ι light the pyre? The day is already half dead.

Men. You yourself cause the delay by talking to me.

Pen. Puneh out my eye through the sole of my foot, Me-
naechmu8‚ if Ι say a single word to you unless you order it!

Men.⁴ (M otioniny to him.) Come here, away from the door.

Pon. So be it.

Men. (M otwmnq ayain. ) Come still farther this way.

Pon. All right.

Men. (I mpatze‘ntly ) Now retreat boldly from the den of
π the lionesS.

Pon. Ahl by hokeyl according to my notion, surely you
would make an excellent charioteer. Men. Why, pray?

Pon. You keep looking around now and then to see that·
your wife is not following.

Men. Well, what say you?

Pon. 1? Whatever forsooth you desire, that do I say and
that deny.

Men. Well said! This mantle shall now be carried to my
dear mistress Erotium. I shall give orders that a feast be
spread soon for you, for her, and for myself. There we shall
1 drink until the rising of to- -morrow' s morning star.

Pon. Good! you have spoken to the point. Shall I knoek
at the door now?

Men. Yes, but wait a moment.

Pon. You've put the bowl a mile away.

Men. Tap gently.

Pon. You are afraid, I suppose, that the doors are of Sa-
mian ware! ’
