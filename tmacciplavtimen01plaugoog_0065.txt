fasted on board ship, thence Ι came out here and hm&

you.

Ero. Ah, wretched me, I am undone 1 Of what ship ‚are
you speaking?

Mon. Sos. A wooden ship, often buffeted, often rent, often
thumped with the mallet. Peg is very near to peg, as in a
furrier's block.

Ero. Now Ι beg of you, quit making fun of me and come ’

along with me.
Men. Sos. Woman, you are looking for some other man,

not me.

Ero. Don’t I know you, Menaechmus, son of your father
. MoschuS, said to have been born at Syracuse in Sicily, when
King Agathocles was ruler‚ and then Pintia, next Liparo, who
at his death bequeathed the kingdom to Hiero, the present
ruler?

· Mon. Sos. Woman, you do not tell that which is untrue.

Mes. In J upiter's name! Didn't this woman come from
there, she knows you so well? Ero. Let us go within to dinner.

Men. Sos. (Apart to MEssENlo.) By Hercules, Ι think Ι
can’t deny her!

Mes, (Apart.) Don't you do it. You are lost, if you go in-
side the threshold.

Mon. Sos. (Apart.) Pray‚ do be still, it's all right. I'll
agree to whatever the woman say3‚ if I can thus get enter-
tainment. (To EROTIUM.) For some time, lady, I have pur-
posely opposed you. I was afraid lest this fellow would tell
my wife about the mantle and the dinner. Now when you

will, let us go in.
Ero Are you waiting for your parasite too?
