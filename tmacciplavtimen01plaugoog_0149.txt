brother, let us return to our native country.

Mon. Brother, I shall do as you wish. I will make an aue·
tion and sell whatever I have. Now, in the meantime, let us
go into the house.

Men. Sos. Very well.

· Mes. (To MENAECHMUS.) Do you know what I desire of
you?

Uen. What?

Mes. That you make me auctioneer.

Uen. It shall be done.

Mes. Do you wish then that I immediately announee that
the. auction will take place?

Men. Certainly, a week from to-day. (The MENAECHMI
90 inside the house.)

Men. (Cominy forward.) There will be an auction of the
property of Menaechmus a week from to·day in the forenoon.
The slaveS, the furniture, the land, the house, will be sold, —
everything for what it will bring for eash down. Even his
wife also will be sold. I think he will hardly realize fifty
hundred thousand sesterces from the entire sale.

Now, spectatorS, farewell, and applaud us vigorously.
(Exit.)
