ACT I.

Somne I.

A street in Epidamnus. The house at the riyht of the audi-

the left belonys to EROTIUM. The street on the riyht

Pon. (Soliloquizes.) The boys have given me the name
Peniculus ¹ because when Ι eat Ι sweep the table clean. Men
that bind captives with chains and put shackles on fugitive
slaves act very foolishly, in my opinion at least. For if a
wretched man has insult added to injury, he will have a
greater desire to run away or to act badly. Bondmen get
out of their chains in some way or other ; they cut through
the ring of their shackles with a file, or strike off the fas-
tening with a stone. All precautions are useless. If you wish
to guard ,α man properly that he may not run away, you
should bind him with food and drink3 you can fasten a
man' s nose to a full table. So long as you give him some-
thing to eat and drink, at his own pleasure‚ to satiety every
day, by heavenS, he will never run away, even if he has com-
mitted a capital crime. You will easily keep him, if you bind

’ him with that chain. These food chains are so very elastic

the more you stretch them, the more tightly they bind.
