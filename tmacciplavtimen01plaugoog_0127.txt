Sor-:NE IV.

Enter MESSENIQ cominy from the tavern.

Mes. (Soliloquizes.) This is the criterion of a good slave, —
that he takes care of his master's busineSS, looks after it, regu-
lates it, makes a study of it, so that in the absence of his lord
he as carefully guards the property as he would if the master
himself were present, or more carefully. (He whose heart is
‘rightly placed ought to consider his back of more importance
than his gullet‚ his legs than his stomachss‘ Let those that are
¹ of no account consider what reward is given by masters to
worthless‚ disreputable men. Blows, fetters, the mill, fatigue,
hunger, intense cold, — these are the rewards of worthless-
, ness. Ι fear this punishment exceedingly.

I very e'asily endure wordS‚ I despise blows, I much more
willingly eat ground meal than grind the meal. Wherefore, I
obey the⁸ command of my master, properly and quietly observe
it. I as a slave conduct myself as I think is to the advantage
of my back, and that is to my interest. Let others do as

they think is to their interest ; Ι shall doas I ought. . If I
' maintain this principle, 1 shall avoid censure. As long as 1
am ready for my master on all occasionS, 1 shall not be much
