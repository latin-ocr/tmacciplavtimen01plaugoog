Serum 111.] MENAECHMI 41

The dinner, as you directed, has been provided here.
When you wish you may go and take your place.

Mon. Sos. (To MESSENIO.) With whom is this woman
talking? Ero. (To MENAECHMUS.) With you, of course.

Men. Sos. What business have I ever had with you, or
have I now?

Ero. Why, in truth‚ Venus has desired that I exalt you
alone above all others ; and γοα are not undeserving of it
either, for surely γοα alone make me prosperous by your kind
acts.

Mon. Sos. (A part to MEssENIO.) Certainly this woman is
either crazy or drunk, Messenio, who addresses me, a stranger,
so familiarly.

Mes. (Apart.) Didn't I say it was the custom here to do
such things? The leaves are now falling, as a matter of
comparison with what will happen if we stay here three days;
by that time the trees will be falling on γοα. For the women
here are of this kind, that they are all money getters. But
just let me talk to this woman. Hello, woman, it's to you,
I’m speaking! Ero. What is it?

Mes. Where did you get acquainted with this gentleman?

Ero. In the same place where he got acquainted with me
some time ago, in Epidamnus.

Mes. In Epidamnus? with a man that never set foot in-
side this city until to-day‘?

Ero. Oh! you're joking. (To Mnmncmuns.) My dear
MenaechmuS, why, I pray you, don't you go inside? It will
be pleasanter for you in there (she starts toward her door).

Men. Sos, (Apart.) In truth‚ this woman does certainly
call me by my right name. I wonder what this means?

⁸ Mes. (Apart to MENAECHMUS.) She has smelled the purse
that you have.
