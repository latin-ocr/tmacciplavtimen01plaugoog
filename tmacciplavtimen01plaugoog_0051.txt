samm L] MENAECHMI 31

Mes. You are seeking a knot in a bulrush. Why don't we
return home, unless indeed we are going to write a book of ,
travels?

Men. Soa. You'd better not make smart speecheS, unless
you want a beating. Don't bother me. This matter will not
be arranged to please you.

Mes. (Aside.) Hml By that speech indeed Ι see that Ι am
a slave. He could not with such distinctness have expressed
more in a few wordS. But nevertheless Ι cannot refrain from
speaking. (To MENAECHMUS.) Listen‚ Menaechmus! When
Ι look into the purse, Ι see that we are, in truth‚ equipped as if.
for a summer's journey. By Hercules, I certainly think that
unless γοα return home you will be reduced to poverty, and
will pay the penalty for this search for your twin brother.
For the people here are of this sort: among the Epidamnians
a‘re revellers and very hard drinkers; very many sharpers and
tricksters, too, dwell in this city, and nowhere in the world
· are the women considered more enticing. On this account
the name Epidamnus has been given to this place, because
scarcely anyone leaves here without some damage.

Men. Sos. Ι shall look out for that. (Holdinq out his
hand.) Just give that purse to me.

Mes. (Drawiny back.) What do you want it for?

Men. Sos. I am afraid of you, because you talk sc.

Mes. Why are you afraid?

Men. Soc. Lest you cause me some damage in Epidamnus
You are a great lover of women, Messenio ; Ι, on the other
’ hand, arn an irascible man, of ungovernable temper. When Ι
get the money, Ι shall see to it that you do not wrong me

and that I do not get angry at you.
(Giviny him the pur-se. ) Take it and keep it. I am

willing you should have it.
