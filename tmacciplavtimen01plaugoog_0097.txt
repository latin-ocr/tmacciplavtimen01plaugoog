returning, and now see you for the first time since then.

Ero. Ι see what γοα are up to ; you are trying to find a
way to cheat me out of what you gave me.

Men. By my saith, I don't ask this in order to cheat yon,
but I tell you my wife has found it out.

Ero. I did* not ask γοα to give me the mantle‚ γοα volun-
tarily brought it to me. You gave it to me as a gift. Now
you ask it back. Ι shall permit you to take it. Keep it for
yourself. Take it away. Use. it, either γοα or your wife, or
lock it up in your chest. Don't flatter yourself 1 After to-
day you shall never put foot in here, since you despise me,
who deserve so much at your hands. Unless γοα bring
money, you are left out in the eold. You ean't fool me.
Find some other woman to deceive (she 9038 into the
house).

Men. In sooth‚ at last quite angry. Hallo, you! Ι say,
wait 1 Come back 1 Won't you even stop? Won't you even
turn around for my sake? She has gone in. She has shut
the doors, Now Ι ειῐανθτγ muchly shut out ; and now I'm
not believed at all, either at home nor with my mistress.
I'll go and consult my friends in regard ‘to this matter, as
to what they think ought to be done. (Exit.)
