Men. Ι am a Sicilian, of Syracuse.

Men. 808. Ι am of the same city and country.

J truth am this man's slave, but (pointiny to MENAECHMUS
f Sosrcmzs) Ι thought I was this man's. (To MENAECHMUS.)
ἰ Ι thought he was you ; Ι have even caused him some trouble. ’
¹ (To MENAECHMUS SOSICLES.) Ι beg your pardon if 1 have
' said anything foolish or ill-advised to you.

ν > Men. 808. It strikes me you are crazy. Don't you remem-

Uen. Yes indeed, young man, of my father. Ι don' t wish
to seize your father and carry him off.

Mea. (Aside.) Ye immortal gods! grant me the unhoped
for hope that Ι entertain ; for unless my soul deceives me, .
these are the twin brothers, for they speak of a country and
a father that each alike had.
