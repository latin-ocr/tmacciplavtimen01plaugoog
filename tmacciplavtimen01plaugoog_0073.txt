senna VJ MENAECHMI 53

diately Ι begin to agree with her as if she were right. What-
ever the woman said, the same said Ι. What's the use of
talking? I never was so well off at less expense.

Pon. (Aside.) I shall go to the man, for I long to have a
bout with him.

Men. 808. Who is this coming at me?

Pon. What do you say, you man of less weight than a ,

feather, you most villainous and most contemptible scandal
of a fellow, you dead-beat and man of no account? Why
have I deserved this at your hands? Why do you ruin me?'
Why did you sneak away from me a while ago in the Forum?
Why have you consumed my dinner in my absence? Why
did you dare to eat what was as much mine as it was
yours?

Mon. 808. Young man, I beg of you, what business have
Ι with you that you designedly insult me, a stranger here?
Do you wish me to punish you for your insults?

Pon. Indeed I think, by Pollux, you have already punished
me.

Mon. 808. Answer me, young fellow‚ I beg of you ; what
is your name? -

Pon. Do you even scoff at me? As if you didn't know
my name 1

Men. 808. Truly, as far as Ι know, I never saw you before
to-day, and I do not know you ; but certainly, whoever you
are, if you do right, you will not abuse me.

Pon. Don’t you know me?

Men. 808. If I did know you I wouldn't deny it.

Pon. Menaechmus, wake up 1

Men.- 808. By Hercules, Ι am indeed awake, so far as I
know. ⁴

Pon. Don’t you know your own parasite?

Mon. 808. Young man, your pate is not sound, I think.
