band secretly steals whatever is at home and carries it off to
his mistress?

Pon. Why don’t you be quiet? I'll warrant you will soon
catch him in the act ; just follow this‘way. Drunk, and
crowned with a ehaplet, he was carrying to the embroiderer's
the mantle that he stole from you to-day at home. (Sees the
chaplet.) But lo 1 here is ‘the chaplet that he had. Do I
lie? See, he has gone this way, if you want to follow him by
his tracks. (θρίω MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.) But, by
heavenS, see there 1 he is coming back at a very opportune
time 3 but he doesn't bring the mantle.

Pon. The same as usual ; scold him.

Wfle. I think I shall do so.

Pen- Let us step aside here and wateh him from ambush
(they withdraw to the back of the staqe).
