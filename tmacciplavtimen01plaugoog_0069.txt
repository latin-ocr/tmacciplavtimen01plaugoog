SCENE IV.

Pon. . (Soliloquizea) Ι have lived now more than thirty
years and during all that time Ι have never done anything
more foolish or more disastrous than what Ι did to-day, when,
fool that IwaS, Ι plunged into the midst of a crowd, and

vited to dine out, and that do not entertain anybody. These
ought to give their attention to assemblies and conventionS.
