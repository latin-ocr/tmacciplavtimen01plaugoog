Scmm VLJ MENAECHMI 59

opportunity and time are⁸ given me to get away from these
procurers' dens? Hasten, MenaechmuS, stir your stepS,
quicken your gait. I shall take off this chaplet and throw
it to the left hand, so that if they follow me, they may think
Ι have gone off in this way. I'll go and find my slave if I
can, that he may know at once from me of the good things

that the gods give me. (Exit.)
