INTRODUCTION xi

In the French‚ Rotrou’s “Les Menechmes’' (Paris,
1632) is hardly more than a translation, although
Erotium is made a rather stupid but amiable widow.
Regnard’s “Les Menechmes ou les jumeaux” (1705)
is a lively adaptation of the “Menaechmi ’⁹ to the
French life of the time. Other free French transla-
tions are those of Boursault and of Cailhava.

The first translation in English was entitled “Me-
naechmi‚ a pleasant and finely conceited comedie, taken
out of the most excellent wittie Poet Plautus, chosen

purposely from out the rest, as least harmefull‚ and yet
most delightfull. Written in English by W. W. [sup-
posed to be William Wa1·ner]‚ London‚ printed by Tho.
Creede‚ and are to be sold by William Barley at his
shop in Gratious-streete. 1595.” A “Historie of Er-
ror” was performed by the children of Paul’s‚ “on
New-yeres daie at night‚” 1576-7. Shakspeare’s ‘⁶ Com-
edy of Errors” was probably produced in 1595. The
chief points of difference between the “Menaechmi ”.
and “The Comedy of Errors ’⁹ are, that the part of
Peniculus is entirely wanting in the latter, and that
the part of Erotium in the “ Menaechmi ” is made much
more prominent than that of the corresponding char-
acter in Shakspeare's play. Shakspeare more than
compensates for the loss of these two characters by
the introduction of the two Bromios, who as servants
of the two leadingcharacters carry still further the
complication of the plot arising from mistaken identity.
