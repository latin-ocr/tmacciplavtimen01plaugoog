Scmm 1.] MENAECHMI 81

Men. 808. What's that to me, whether you can stand it
to live in· wedlock or are going to separate from your hus-
band? Is such the custom here, to talk gossip to a stranger
as soon as he meets you?

wite. What gossip? Ι will not, Ι say, bear it any longer,
but will live as a widow rather than put up with your be-
havior.

Men. 808. By Hercules, as far as Ι at least am concerned,
you may live as a widow even as long as Jupiter retains the
kingship 1 .

wife. In Castor’s name I shall certainly summon my father
immediately and tell him of the outrages that you perpetrate.
(Galla into the house.) Go, Decio, hunt up my father, and
have him· come with you to me. Tell him that Ι need him.
(Decio enters from the house and yoes out to the riqht. To
MENAECHMUS.) I'll expose those wicked acts of yours.

Men. Sos. What wicked acts of mine?

i, wile. You steal'mantles and gold from your wife at home,
,' and carry them off to your mistress, Do I state these points

quite correctly‘?

Men. 808. Bah 1 by heavens, woman, you are very insolent
and¹ wicked. Do you dare say this was stolen from you,
which another woman gave to me to have trimmed‘?

wife. Awhile ago you did not deny that you had stolen it
from me. Do you bring the same thing before my eyes now?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself ?

Men. 808. In soot‘h, woman, if you can, give me some
patience potion that Ι may be able to endure your insolence.
What man you think Ι ‘amj Ι know not. Ι got acquainted
with you at the same time that Ι did with Porthaon.

wife. (Seeiny her father cominy.) Even if you mock me,
still you surely cannot mock him, my father, who is coming
hither. Why don't you look back? Don't you know him?

Men. 808. Ι know him as well as Ι do Calchas Ι saw
him the same day on wh'ich Ι saw you before to-day.
