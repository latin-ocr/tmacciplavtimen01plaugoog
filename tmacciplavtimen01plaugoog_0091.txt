scmm IL] ’ MENAECHMI 71

Surely Ι am a wretched woman.

Men. Why are you wretched? Explain to me.

wife. Do you ask me?

Men. Surely Ι shouldn't ask you, if Ι knew.

Pon. Oh! villainous man, how he dissembles Ξ You can't
conceal it, she knows all about it. By heavenS‚ Ι have told
everything.

(To the WIFE. ) What does this mean?

wife. Since you are ashamed of nothing and do not wish
to confess of your own accord, attend and hear: A mantle has
been stolen from me at home. * ‘s

Men. A mantle has been stolen from me?

Pon. (To the WIFE.) Do you see how the scoundrel catches
you up? (To MENAECHMUS.) It was stolen from her, not
from you ; for certainly, if it had been stolen from you it
would now be safe.

Men. (To PENICULUS.) Ι have nothing to do with you.
(To his WIFE.) But what do you say?

wife. Amantle, Ι say, has disappeared from the house.

Men. Who stole it?

wife. In sooth, he who took it away, knows that.

Men. Who is the man? wife. One Menaechmus,

Men. By heavenS‚ it was a villainous deed. Who is that
Menaechmus?

wite. You are he. Men. I? wife. You.

Men. Who accuses me?

wite. Ι, to be sure.

Pon. And Ι, and you carried it off to your mistreSS,
Erotium.

Men. Did Ι give it to her?

Pon. You, you Ι say. Do you want an owl brought here
to say you-ooh‚ you-ooh‚ continually to you? We are now
worn out.
